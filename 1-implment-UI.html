Absence of Email Notifications for Email Address ChangesVulnerability Type: Security MisconfigurationDescription: The system does not send email notifications to the original email address when a user's email address is changed. This lack of notification creates a security gap, as users are not informed of unauthorized or unintended changes to their account's email address, which is often a critical component of account recovery and authentication processes.
