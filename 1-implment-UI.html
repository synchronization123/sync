Vulnerability Title:
Improper Authentication During Email Update Allows Unauthorized Changes

Description:
The application allows users to update their registered email address by entering any random password in the "current password" field. It does not properly validate whether the entered password matches the user’s actual current password. As a result, a user can successfully update their email address without proper authentication.

Impact:
This flaw bypasses the intended security control of verifying user identity before sensitive account changes. It opens up the risk of unauthorized email updates, which can further lead to account takeover, especially in cases where email is used for password resets or multi-factor authentication.

Steps to Reproduce:

1. Log in to a legitimate user account.


2. Navigate to the "Profile" or "Account Settings" section.


3. Choose to update the email address.


4. Enter a new email address.


5. In the “current password” field, input any random string (not the actual password).


6. Submit the form.


7. Observe that the email address is successfully updated.



Expected Behavior:
The application should verify that the current password entered matches the logged-in user’s actual password before allowing the email to be updated.

Severity: High

Recommendation:
Implement proper password validation before allowing email address changes. The system should compare the entered password against the user’s actual stored (hashed) password and only proceed if it matches.

Vulnerability Title:

Client-Side Enforcement of Authentication Method Selection Allows Unauthorized SMS Option Activation


---

Description:

In the MFA (Multi-Factor Authentication) settings screen, users are allowed to choose the second factor from a dropdown menu with options such as Authentication App (Google/MS Authenticator), Email, and Phone SMS. However, Phone SMS is visibly disabled in the dropdown under normal usage.

Despite this restriction, a user can use browser developer tools to remove the disabled attribute from the <option> tag corresponding to Phone SMS. Once modified, the user can select the SMS option and successfully save it, even though this method is not intended to be active or available.

If the SMS value is stored incorrectly or as blank, it may disrupt OTP delivery—potentially preventing users from logging in or compromising MFA flow integrity.


---

Impact:

Security controls enforced only on the client side are easily bypassed by users.

Improper configuration of authentication method may result in:

Broken login flow (no OTP received).

User lockouts.

Bypass of intended authentication policy (e.g., SMS disabled for security reasons).


Could lead to a weakened MFA configuration or denial of access.

CVSS v3.1 Vector (Estimated):

CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:L
Score: 7.4 (High)

Privileged users (PR:L) can abuse developer tools to enable forbidden auth types.

Could impact confidentiality (OTP manipulation), integrity (auth method tampered), and availability (login OTP fails).



---

Recommendation:

1. Enforce server-side validation for all authentication method updates:

Reject any unsupported or disabled options, regardless of client-side input.



2. Use a whitelist on the backend to allow only permitted MFA methods.


3. Sanitize and validate input from the client to ensure it hasn’t been tampered with.


4. Log and monitor such tampering attempts as potential abuse or misuse indicators.
