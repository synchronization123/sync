Hi Ram,

From the list provided, the entries highlighted in red correspond to test projects.

The AppSec team conducts daily monitoring of SonarQube, and any newly detected traces are taken up for review. As of now, there are only 10 traces in Open status that are relevant for action â€” this excludes 20 traces identified from test applications.

Additionally, we will be reviewing the Confirmed traces associated with JIRAs that have been marked as Done, and we will update their corresponding statuses in SonarQube accordingly.
