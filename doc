Role	Responsibility

SOC (Security Operations Center)	Monitor CSP reports, analyze dashboard data, and initiate IRs when anomalies are detected.

4. Process Overview

1. CSP reports are automatically generated when violations occur in the ePayment application.


2. These reports are captured in the csprreports table_data and pushed to Splunk.


3. The data is presented on the ePayment Compliance Dashboard for visibility.


4. The SOC team monitors the dashboard and reviews any policy violations.


5. If a suspicious or confirmed issue is identified, the SOC raises an Incident Record (IR) for the AppSec team.


6. The AppSec team reviews the IR and, if required, creates a Jira ticket for the issue.


7. The Development team remediates the issue as per the guidance and SLA.
