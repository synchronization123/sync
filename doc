CSP Monitoring Process

CSP report data (cspreports table_data) is automatically ingested into Splunk for centralized analysis and monitoring.

The data is visualized through the ePayment Compliance Dashboard, enabling real-time oversight of policy violations.

The Security Operations Center (SOC) is responsible for continuously monitoring CSP-related alerts and anomalies.

If a potential security concern is identified, the SOC will initiate an Incident Report (IR) and escalate the issue to the Application Security (AppSec) team for further investigation.

Upon review, the AppSec team will assess the report and, if warranted, log a Jira ticket to track remediation activities and ensure timely resolution
